6. The player column contains the source the user is using to view the stream (site, iphone, android, etc).
Create a list of players and their number of streamers.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total players',
    player
    FROM stream
    GROUP BY player
    ORDER BY 1 DESC ;

Create a new column named genre for each of the games.
Group the games into their genres: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), First Person Shooter (FPS), Survival, and Other.

SELECT game, genre=
    CASE 
        WHEN game = 'League of Legends' THEN 'MOBA'
        WHEN game = 'Dota 2' THEN 'MOBA'
        WHEN game = 'Heroes of the storm' THEN 'MOBA'
        WHEN game = 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' THEN 'FPS'
        WHEN game = 'DayZ' THEN 'Survival'
        WHEN game = 'ARK: Survival Evolved' THEN 'Survival'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END
FROM stream
GROUP BY game
ORDER BY genre;

SQLite comes with a strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.
It takes two arguments:
strftime(format, column)
Let’s test this function out:

    SELECT time,
       strftime('%S', time)
    FROM stream
    GROUP BY 1
    LIMIT 20;
    
What do you think this does? Open the hint if you’d like to learn more.

SELECT  TOP (10) DATEPART (second,time)
FROM stream 
;

Okay, now we understand how strftime() works. Let’s write a query that returns three columns:
The hours of the time column
The view count for each hour
Lastly, filter the result with only the users in your country using a WHERE clause.
--hecho con SQlite


SELECT time,
   strftime('%H', time) AS hour,
   COUNT(*) AS Viewers
FROM stream
WHERE country = 'ES'
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
